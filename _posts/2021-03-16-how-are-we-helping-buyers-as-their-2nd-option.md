<center><em>Here’s why you always need to be ready to help prospects.</em></center>

Recently, I was checking in on some buyers I had previously spoken with—buyers who, at the time, informed me they were already working with a Realtor.

**I had found it quite interesting that these buyers were reaching out to us about properties for sale even though they already had an agent working for them.&nbsp;**

This is what I’ve been telling my agents: If you talk to someone who is already working with an agent, make sure you’re checking back in with them on a regular basis. See what’s going on in their life; they might need some assistance.**&nbsp;**It could be as simple as sending them a market overview or some new listings that fit what they’re looking for.&nbsp;

The buyers I reached out to were so happy to hear from me because they were still looking at homes and hadn’t even heard from their own agent.&nbsp;**There’s gold in your CRM if you know where to look.**

If you have any questions for me about these kinds of leads or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
