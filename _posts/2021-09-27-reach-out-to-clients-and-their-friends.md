People are looking for properties on behalf of their friends.

&nbsp;

Today we want to give you a couple of tips on lead generation and expanding your database. My team recently spoke with buyers in the market today who are looking at online listings for their friends. We said that it'd be our pleasure to send them properties that they could look at for their friend and send them to them. **Even if they get back to us and say that their friend isn’t interested, sometimes they are interested themselves and want to see the property.** Don’t pass up these folks who are looking on their friend’s behalf because you might be warming up a future client.

If you have any questions or are interested in looking at properties, don’t hesitate to reach out to my team. We’d love to hear from you and help you in any way we can.
