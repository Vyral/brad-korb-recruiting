Today I want to talk about how you should approach Zillow for-sale-by-owner properties. When you see an FSBO home, that means the owner wants to sell their house; it doesn’t mean they don’t want to cooperate with brokers. Most of the time, they would be overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork they have to do.&nbsp;

You have a great opportunity to help them. **I personally reach out to them and say I have a great buyer who wants their home.** I ask if they’d be willing to work with a Realtor so long as I can get them the price they’re looking for. 99% of the time, they’ll agree.

They want to sell their house, and they appreciate the help you can give them with all the paperwork. If you have any questions, feel free to call or email my team or me. We’d love to help.
