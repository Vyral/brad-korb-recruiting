Time blocking and prospecting are critical for your business. I make sure I time block first thing in the morning and afternoon.

**As soon as I come into the office, I do prospecting.** I put on my happy face and call new leads, follow up with leads that need it, record video texts, send out emails, and make BombBomb video emails. You have to spend time daily on your lead follow-up.&nbsp;

I also notice a lot of agents who do a one-and-done: They’ll call a new lead one time, and **if that lead doesn't respond, they move on to the next.** This is a huge no-no for your business. You should engage leads with at least a 10-day plan that includes emails, voicemails, video texts, and BomBomb video emails.&nbsp;

I’m usually more successful between the third and tenth attempts. You should also set up some time to call your leads in the afternoon. If you can’t reach them in the morning, try again in the evening.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about time blocking or prospecting, feel free to call or email me or my team. We’d love to help you.
