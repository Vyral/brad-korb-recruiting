There will be three types of sales people in our industry at the end of 2022. Which will you choose to be?

We’re experiencing the lowest inventory levels in residential real estate that we’ve seen in decades.

How we as brokers and licensees choose to respond will make the difference between success and failure this year.

1️. The first person will not be here in our industry at the end of the year. They will blame the industry for their failure and seek opportunities elsewhere.

2️. The second person will struggle, have a difficult year in their business, but will make it through. They will also blame the market for the difficulties in their business.

3️. The third person will recognize the challenges in the market and return to the basic principles which brought them success:

* Focused and consistent lead generation.
* Contact and follow up with personal sphere.
* Focusing only on that which they control; the effort that they can put into their business every day.

There are opportunities in every market. I hope you’ll be the third person and remain positive while focusing on what you control. See you in 2023\!
