It’s April 2022, and across the country, we’re experiencing the lowest home inventory levels in decades. Lots of Realtors are starting to feel the uncertainty of this market. Now more than ever, it’s important to stay consistent and work to be successful. Let me explain why.

Put yourself in the end-of-year mindset. It’s December 2022, and we’re already planning for next year. There will be three different types of Realtors at this time. Which one do you want to be?

**The first type of Realtor won’t be there.** They will have dropped out of the industry. If you look around your brokerage, some of the agents won’t be here come December, and they will blame the market.&nbsp;

**The second type of agent will have had a tough year.** They struggled but managed to make it through. Maybe they got frustrated and almost quit, deciding to stick it out a bit longer. They will blame the market and say that it’s why they struggled.

**The third Realtor will have recognized the market change.** They realized that it was a difficult market due to low inventory and went back to the basics. They called their sphere of influence, followed the leads in their database, and stayed consistent with follow-up.&nbsp;

If you’re like most agents, you’ve gotten behind just catching up on inquiries. Actual lead generation has fallen to the side. Now’s the time to pick it back up. Spend two or three hours every day calling or texting people and asking if they know anyone who’s looking to buy or sell. Reach out to those clients that fell off your radar.

Things are going to change. The best thing you can do is change your tactics before it’s too late. Instead of focusing on what’s happening around you that you can’t control, focus on what you can control.

I hope you can be that third type of agent at the end of the year. If you have any questions, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to hear from you.
