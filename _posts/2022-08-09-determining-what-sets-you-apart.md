Any agent aiming for success should ask themselves: Why should a buyer work with me? We are transitioning into a whole new market, and we have to adjust to that change. That includes always giving buyers the best they can get.&nbsp;

In these times, it is important to **have a relationship with the buyers.** If you aren’t sure what they are looking for in a relationship, ask them\! I would recommend always giving them 150% to 200% of what they’re looking for.&nbsp;

Another great thing you can do is **become the local expert in the neighborhood.** You should be able to tell a buyer about local restaurants, parks, schools, shopping areas, and more.&nbsp;

Lastly, I strongly believe you should **always know what is going on with the housing market.** What’s for sale? What’s pending in escrow? What has sold in the last 35 to 60 days? For example, know that you shouldn't look at comps from six months ago because that will show houses selling for way over the listing price, which is not what is going on in the market today.&nbsp;

Working with buyers is quite different from how it was three months ago. It is your turn to shine in today’s market. I’m here to support you. If you have any questions or comments, I’m always just an email or phone call away.
