<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</P>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. You understand your potential and are motivated to work toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them.</P>

<p>Many brokerages promise to provide structure, coaching, and other resources, but fail to make good on their word once they’ve drawn you in. <strong>As a result of this and other factors, 87% of all new agents fail within their first year of joining the industry.</strong></P>

<p>The reason so many agents drop out of the business is simple: They get discouraged because they’re not getting leads, guidance, or money.</P>

<p>Even the most hardworking agent won’t get anywhere if they aren’t headed in the right direction.</P>

<p>It’s time to stop chasing dead ends. It’s time to forge your own path to success.</P>

<p>My name is Brad Korb and I’ve been in the real estate business for over 40 years. I started in real estate because I didn’t want a regular job. I was willing to pay whatever price needed to become successful and I did just that.</P>

<p>I’ve seen people rack up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, waste time and money on useless activities, and jump from shiny object to shiny object as a result of their failed attempts to succeed in real estate. These people lay awake at night wondering if entering the industry was a mistake—questioning whether they should just cut their losses and fall back into a regular 9-to-5 job. They’ve simply lost hope and the bills are mounting up.</P>

<p><strong>If this sounds familiar, then consider this message your lifeline.</strong></P>

<p>I’ve trained many agents just like you—I’ve taken people struggling to stay afloat in life, let alone their business, and turned them into top-producing real estate professionals, and I can do the same for you. Our buyer’s agent mentorship program has been particularly successful in teaching our systems and processes to teach agent’s success. I know what it takes for you to take your business to the next level.</P>

<p>I know this because I’ve been in your shoes. I’ve been in the same rut you find yourself in now, and I know what it takes to get out. Let me explain what I mean.</P>

<p><strong>By joining our team, you get more. In addition to our mentorship program, we offer:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Open house opportunities</li>
<li>Floor calls</li>
<li>Business cards</li>
<li>Headshots</li>
<li>Your own website</li>
<li>No desk fees</li>
<li>Over $40,000 worth of marketing each month</li>
<li>A private newspaper that has a larger readership than the actual newspaper</li>
</ul></p>

<p>With that said, we don’t expect you to have all the answers. We want to provide as much as we can to help you on the path to success. We’ll teach you every step of the way.</P>

<p>Our systems truly work, but don’t just take my word for it. Consider the story of Deanna.</P>

<p>She came to us after working with two other brokerages. After joining our team, she ended up doing more business in one year with us than she did in six years at the two other brokerages.</P>

<p>Or you can look at the story of another one of our agents, Sunny. He had just recently graduated from college and did 13 deals his first year and was very close to a six-figure income. </P>

<p>Their stories are incredible, but now it’s time for you to start writing your own.</P>

<p><strong>After all, the choice is in your hands.</strong> You can stay struggling where you’re at, join a big-box brokerage where you’ll get no support, or even quit the industry altogether and go get started working at a 9-to-5 job—or you can join Brad Korb Real Estate and start leading the life you deserve.</P>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. People join us because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community. We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide. In fact, we guarantee that you’ll be writing offers within three months of joining us.</P>

<p>Once you join our team, here’s what the onboarding process looks like. It starts with our 12-week training program, where we have you shadowing agents, learning contracts, attending inspections, meeting with our preferred vendors, training in our CRM and other systems, and eventually making calls to our database of over 40,000 leads.</P>

<p>So what are you waiting for? It’s time to take control of your future and see firsthand how joining us can transform your life and career. Have you noticed that the market is shifting? <strong>The longer you wait to reach out, the longer you’re suppressing your true potential.</strong> Let’s have a conversation today.</P>

<p>I look forward to talking to you soon!</P>

<p>Brad Korb</P>
